# Wordle Clone

## Description

A simple wordle clone created using React.js and Typescript. Used the context API to manage the application states.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Typescript
- CSS
- APIs from [random-word-api](http://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) and [api.dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Create React App

### Running the app locally

1. Clone the repository and then install dependencies
```sh
git clone https://github.com/normanmgu/wordle-react-typescript.git
npm install
```

2. Start Development Server
```sh
npm run dev
```

3. Open the given localhost that the app generates for you, in my case I got http://localhost:5173/

### Deployment
The app is currently deployed on Netlify at this link: https://shiny-pithivier-22874d.netlify.app/

### Note
- The app is using a couple of APIs, and the limit of requests to these APIs are limited. If the app is not working, it could be because the request limit has been exceeded.
